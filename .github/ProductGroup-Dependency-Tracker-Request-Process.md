# How to submit a Product Group Dependency Tracker Request 
*A guide for ISE team members who need to submit a dependency tracker request to link an ISE Azure DevOps (ADO) engagement to work that ISE is requesting a Product Group complete. A Product Group may request ISE submit a dependency so the Product Group can review it during semester planning.*

## Step 1: Connect with the TPM/Product Owner for the Product Group requesting the Dependency Tracker Request 
  •	Pre work: ISE drafts request title, description, and business impact.
  
  •	Review the request with the Product Group TPM and obtain the following information: 
  
     o Producer ADO details: ADO organization, project, area path, assigned to 
     
     o Priority Ranking (for Azure producers) following priority guidance
     
     o Classification 

## Step 2: Submit Dependency Tracker Request
  •	Access the Dependency Tracker board for the Product Group.
  
     o Example: Azure Core Dependency Tracker Board
     
  •	Select ‘Create dependency’
  
  •	Complete the Producer’s work item tab.
  
     o Select Type of dependency: New dependency
     
     o Select Create by: Azure DevOps Account
     
     o Complete the Producer’s contact details and Request details sections using the information from the Product 
       Group TPM. 
       
     Click Next.
     
  •	Complete the Requestor’s work item tab. 
  
     o Select Type of dependency: Link dependency
     
     o Complete Requestor’s contact details > Search existing work item section.
     
          - Azure DevOps Account: Industry Solutions
          
          - Work Item: Enter ISE ADO Engagement ID. Click Next. 
          
            • Example: 48720 for Unified Telemetry – M2
            
      Note: Leave the Service Tree section blank. 
          
  •	Review the Summary tab and click Submit. 
  
  •	You will receive a confirmation message on screen.
  
     o Example: The new dependency has been created: '26970520 - Xlens and ImpactRP Integration' is 
       producing for '48720 - WALMART INC. - Unified Systems Telemetry - M2 [2 crews]'.

## Step 3: Confirm Dependency Tracker submission was successful and document ISE ADO
•	ISE does not have permission to view the requests in the Product Group Dependency Tracker, therefore confirm with the Product Group TPM that the request was received. 

•	Add a comment to the ISE engagement in ISE ADO to document the Product Group Dependency Tracker request number.

     o Example: Per the request of the Azure Core group, ISE submitted a Dependency Tracker request in Azure DevOps 
       on February 27th for the Xlens and ImpactRP Integration. This request is required for Azure Core's upcoming
       semester planning. A new dependency has been created: '26970520 - Xlens and ImpactRP Integration' is producing
       for '48720 - WALMART INC. - Unified Systems Telemetry - M2 [2 crews]'.
